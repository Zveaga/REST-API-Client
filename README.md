# Project is a work-in-progress 🔨

This is my first project that involves making API calls to scrape website data. <br/>
<br/>Project goals:
- Implement HTTP requests to the API endpoints
- Parse the JSON file to extract relevant data
- Extract and format data for Discord
- Set up the Discord Webhook
- Send the formatted data to a Discord server
- Set up a scheduler to run the scrapper once a day
